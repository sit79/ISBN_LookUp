# ISBN_LookUp

Had to catalog a bunch of books that I wanted to give away or sell and got inspired to write a small node app to look up the books based on their ISBN. After playing around and looking for a free API, I decided for http://openlibrary.org (you don't need an API key for that one). It produced a lot more hits than the Google Books API.
